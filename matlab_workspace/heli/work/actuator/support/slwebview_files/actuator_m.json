    "Closed-Loop Electrohydraulic Actuator with Proportional Valve\n\nThis example shows an actuator that consists of a proportional 4-way directional valve\ndriving a double-acting hydraulic cylinder. The cylinder drives a load consisting of a mass, \nviscous and Coulomb friction, constant force, and a spring. The actuator is powered \nby a variable-displacement, pressure-compensated pump, driven by a constant velocity\nmotor. Pipelines between the valve, cylinder, pump, and the tank are simulated\nwith the Hydraulic Pipeline blocks.\n\n\nCopyright 2008-2013 The MathWorks, Inc.\n"
